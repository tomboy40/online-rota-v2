# Technology Stack

This document outlines the technology stack used in this project, providing justifications for the selection of each technology.

## Frontend

- **React:** (v18.2.0)
  - Justification: React is chosen for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM for performance, and large community support, making UI development efficient and maintainable. Its declarative nature simplifies UI logic and enhances code readability.
- **Remix:** (v2.5.0)
  - Justification: Remix is selected for its focus on web standards, server-side rendering for performance and SEO, and seamless integration with React. It enhances the application's responsiveness and user experience by providing optimized data loading and routing mechanisms.
- **TypeScript:** (v5.3.0)
  - Justification: TypeScript is used to improve code maintainability, catch errors early during development, and enhance developer productivity through static typing and code intelligence. It provides a robust type system that helps prevent runtime errors and improves code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS:** (v3.4.0)
  - Justification: Tailwind CSS is chosen for rapid UI development, consistent styling through utility classes, and responsive design capabilities. It accelerates the styling process and ensures a cohesive visual appearance across the application.
- **Headless UI:** (v2.2.0)
  - Justification: Headless UI provides accessible, unstyled UI components for React, offering flexibility in UI customization while ensuring accessibility compliance. It allows for building custom-styled, accessible interactive elements like dialogs and menus.
- **Heroicons:** (v2.2.0)
  - Justification: Heroicons provides a set of professionally designed, SVG icons that are easy to integrate with Tailwind CSS. These icons enhance the visual appeal and user interface consistency of the application.
- **date-fns:** (v4.1.0)
  - Justification: date-fns is chosen for its modularity, performance, and comprehensive set of date utility functions. It provides reliable and efficient date manipulation in JavaScript, crucial for calendar-related functionalities.

## Backend

- **Remix (Node.js):** 
  - Justification: Node.js is used as the server runtime for Remix due to its non-blocking I/O model, scalability, and JavaScript ecosystem. It enables efficient server-side rendering, API handling, and seamless integration with the frontend React components.
- **libSQL:** (v0.5.3)
  - Justification: libSQL is likely used for interacting with a SQLite database. SQLite is chosen for its simplicity, file-based nature (suitable for development or smaller deployments), and ease of integration. libSQL provides a lightweight client for accessing SQLite databases.
- **Drizzle ORM:** (v0.29.3)
  - Justification: Drizzle ORM is selected for type-safe database queries, TypeScript integration, and lightweight nature. It provides an efficient and developer-friendly way to interact with the database, ensuring type safety and improving developer productivity.
- **ical.js:** (v2.1.0)
  - Justification: ical.js is used for handling iCalendar data, likely for importing or exporting calendar events in the standard iCalendar format. This enables interoperability with other calendar applications and services.

## Version Control

- **Git:** 
  - Justification: Git is the industry standard for version control, enabling collaboration, tracking changes, and managing codebase history effectively. It is essential for managing code changes, branching, and collaboration within the development team.

## Deployment

- **Remix Serve:** (v2.5.0)
  - Justification: Remix Serve is used for easily deploying and serving the Remix application. It is suitable for simple deployments, demos, or as a starting point for more complex deployment setups.

## Infrastructure

- **Likely Serverless or Node.js Hosting:** 
  - Justification: Serverless or Node.js hosting environments are suitable for Remix applications, offering scalability, ease of deployment, and cost-effectiveness. These environments allow for easy deployment and scaling of Node.js applications.

## Database

- **SQLite:** 
  - Justification: SQLite is chosen for its simplicity, file-based database, and ease of setup. It is well-suited for development, testing, and potentially smaller-scale deployments where a lightweight, embedded database is sufficient.

## ORMs

- **Drizzle ORM:** (v0.29.3)
  - Justification: Drizzle ORM is used as the ORM for this project, providing type-safe database access and management. Its TypeScript integration and lightweight design make it a good choice for efficient and maintainable database interactions.

## UI & Styling

- **React Components:** 
  - Justification: React components are used to build modular, reusable UI elements, promoting maintainability and efficient UI development. They allow for creating a structured and organized UI codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS:** (v3.4.0)
  - Justification: Tailwind CSS is used for styling React components, providing a utility-first approach that enables rapid and consistent UI development.
- **Headless UI:** (v2.2.0)
  - Justification: Headless UI components are used to build accessible and customizable UI elements, ensuring accessibility and flexibility in component styling.
- **Heroicons:** (v2.2.0)
  - Justification: Heroicons are used to enhance the visual appeal of the UI, providing a consistent and professional icon set for various UI elements.

## API Integrations

- **None explicitly listed, but potential for future API integrations:** 
  - Justification: The architecture is designed to accommodate future API integrations as needed, following a modular and extensible approach. This allows for extending the application's functionality by integrating with external services and APIs.

## Monitoring & Error Tracking

- **None explicitly listed:** 
  - Justification: Monitoring and error tracking are likely to be added in later stages of development as the application scales and requires production monitoring. These features are essential for maintaining application health and performance in production environments.

## Authentication

- **None explicitly listed:** 
  - Justification: Authentication is likely to be implemented as a future feature, depending on the application's requirements for user accounts and data privacy. User authentication will be added if user-specific data or access control is required.
