## Project Progress

The project has a solid foundation with core calendar features implemented, including viewing, navigation, calendar management, and search. The technical stack is modern and well-suited for a web application. 

However, several important features are still pending, especially around event management, user collaboration, and advanced calendar functionalities. Further development is needed to address these pending features and improve the overall robustness, performance, and user experience of the Online Rota Calendar.
