# Calendar Implementation Progress

## Features Implemented

1. Calendar Views
   - Month view with grid layout
   - Week view with time-based layout
   - Day view with detailed time slots
   - Support for both full-day and time-based events

2. Event Handling
   - Support for recurring events (daily, with count or until date)
   - Full-day event support
   - Multi-day event support with visual indicators
   - Event color customization
   - Event details dialog

3. Data Management
   - iCal integration
   - Event caching system
   - Real-time color updates
   - Calendar visibility toggling

## Errors Encountered

1. Event Duplication in Month View
   - Issue: Full-day recurring events appeared twice in the month view
   - Root Cause: Incorrect handling of iCal's exclusive end dates and event deduplication
   - Affected Events: Full-day events with recurrence rules (e.g., "active support" and "L1 support")
   - Symptoms:
     - Duplicates started from the second occurrence
     - Events appeared in correct dates but also showed up in subsequent days
     - Issue only affected month view, not day or week views

2. Date Boundary Issues
   - Issue: Full-day events extending into the next day incorrectly
   - Root Cause: Misinterpretation of iCal's date format for full-day events
   - Impact: Caused overlap between consecutive days of recurring events

3. Event Processing Inconsistencies
   - Issue: Events being processed differently across views
   - Root Cause: Inconsistent handling of event boundaries and recurrence rules
   - Impact: Led to visual inconsistencies between different calendar views

## Solutions Implemented

1. Fixed Event Duplication
   - Added proper event deduplication logic:
   ```typescript
   const processedMap = new Map<string, CalendarEvent>();
   // Create unique IDs for each event instance
   const uniqueId = isFullDay
     ? `${event.id}_${eventStart.toISOString().split('T')[0]}_fullday`
     : event.recurrenceId 
       ? `${event.id}_${event.recurrenceId}`
       : `${event.id}_${startTime.toISOString()}`;
   ```

2. Corrected Full-Day Event Handling
   - Fixed date boundary calculations:
   ```typescript
   // For full-day events:
   // - Start time: start of the start day
   // - End time: end of the current day (not extending into next day)
   const eventStart = isFullDay ? startOfDay(startTime) : startTime;
   const eventEnd = isFullDay 
     ? new Date(startOfDay(endTime).getTime() - 1)
     : endTime;
   ```

3. Improved Event Processing
   - Moved event processing to state management:
   ```typescript
   const [processedEvents, setProcessedEvents] = useState<CalendarEvent[]>([]);
   
   // Process events when they change
   useEffect(() => {
     // Event processing logic
     setProcessedEvents(Array.from(processedMap.values()));
   }, [events, currentDate]);
   ```

4. Enhanced Type Safety
   - Added proper typing for full-day events:
   ```typescript
   type CalendarEvent = BaseCalendarEvent & {
     isFullDay?: boolean;
   };
   ```

## Current Status
- All calendar views working correctly
- Event deduplication working as expected
- Full-day events displaying properly
- Recurring events handled consistently across views
- No known issues remaining with event display or processing
